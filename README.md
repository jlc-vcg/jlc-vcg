- 👋 Hi, I’m @jlc-vcg (Josh)
- 👀 I’m interested in pretty much everything, but especially Computing, Physics, Maths and Philosophy.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Git and GitHub for projects with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other basic languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any open-source and charitable projects where I can make a useful impact as a beginner.
- 📫 I don't know how you can contact me via GitHub, but I don't have any external methods shared here.
